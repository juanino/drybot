# drybot
Drybot is a cheap (around $5) water sensor to alert you
via SMS or push message when a sensor detects water.
Common problem spots like under the washer or in the mechanical/furnace room are good spots 
where you should have a water sensor.

# Alerting
Alerts are sent by hitting a url webhook at IFTTT,
"if webhook then send a push notification from ifttt app".
